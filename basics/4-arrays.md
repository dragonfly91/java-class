# Find in Array

Write a method that returns the index of the first occurrence of given integer in an array.
Assume that the index of the first element in the list is zero.
If the number does not exist return -1.
Ask the user for the array size and fill it with random integers from 0 to 100.

Expected Input:

```
Input a value for array size: 10
Input an integer: 5
```

Expected Output (if found):

```
6
```

Expected Output (if not found):

```
-1
```

# Array Sum

Write a program to display the sum of values in an array.
Ask the user for the array size and fill it with random integers from 0 to 100.

Expected Input:

```
Input a value for array size: 5
```

Expected Output:

```
Array: 4, 56, 1, 3, 6
Sum of values: 70
```

# Min and Max

Write a program to display the minimum and maximum values in an array.
Ask the user for the array size and fill it with random integers from 0 to 100.

Expected Input:

```
Input a value for array size: 5
```

Expected Output:

```
Array: 4, 56, 1, 3, 6
Minimum: 1
Maximum: 56
```

# Array Reverse

Write a program to create a new array which contains the the values in the original array, but in reverse order.
Ask the user for the array size and fill it with random integers from 0 to 100.

Expected Input:

```
Input a value for array size: 5
```

Expected Output:

```
Original: 4, 56, 1, 3, 6
Reversed: 6, 3, 1, 56, 4
```

# Array Multiply

Write a program to display the product of values in an array.
Ask the user for the array size and fill it with random integers from 0 to 100.

Expected Input:

```
Input a value for array size: 5
```

Expected Output:

```
Array: 4, 56, 1, 3, 6
Sum of values: 4032
```

# Array Digit Sum

Consider a numbering system where digits of a number are represented as arrays. For example, the number 35723 is represented as an array of 5 elements: 3-5-7-2-3. Write a program which takes two numbers n and m which represent the lengths of two arrays respectively. The program has to generate n and m sized arrays using Random and output a third array which contains the summation of the first two arrays.


Expected Input:

```
Input the size of first number: 5
Input the size of second number: 5
```

Expected Output:

```
First Array: 4, 6, 1, 3, 6
Second Array: 6, 3, 5, 7, 8
Summation Array: 1, 0, 9, 7, 1, 4
```
